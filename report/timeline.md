## ðŸ“… Twoâ€‘Week Timeline

### **Week 1**
**Day 1â€“2**
- **B (Biomedical)**: Select dataset from UCI, preprocess (resize, normalize, split 70/15/15). Commit `data_preprocessing.py` + dataset notes.  
- **A (Mechatronics)**: Draft base CNN architecture (`cnn_model.py`) with placeholder parameters. Write initial README structure.  

**Day 3â€“4**
- **C (ENTC)**: Set up training script (`train_cnn.py`) and run first baseline training with default optimizer (Adam). Save plots of training/validation loss.  
- **D (Electrical)**: Prepare evaluation script (`evaluate.py`) with confusion matrix, precision, recall. Test it on baseline model.  

**Day 5â€“7**
- **A & C**: Tune CNN parameters (filters, kernel sizes, dropout).  
- **B**: Document dataset details in Markdown + commit preprocessing improvements.  
- **D**: Start coding transfer learning setup (`transfer_learning.py`) with pretrained ResNet/VGG.

### **Week 2**
**Day 8â€“9**
- **C**: Run optimizer experiments (Adam vs SGD vs SGD+Momentum). Generate plots + metrics.  
- **D**: Fineâ€‘tune pretrained models on dataset. Save results + plots.  

**Day 10â€“11**
- **A**: Compare CNN vs transfer learning results. Draft discussion on tradeâ€‘offs.  
- **B**: Assist with evaluation (confusion matrix interpretation, biomedical perspective on dataset relevance).  

**Day 12â€“13**
- **All**: Write report sections:  
  - A â†’ CNN design + activation justification  
  - B â†’ Dataset + preprocessing  
  - C â†’ Training + optimizer comparison  
  - D â†’ Evaluation + transfer learning  

**Day 14**
- **A (Lead)**: Final integration of report + repo cleanup.  
- **All**: Final commits, README polish, push report PDF.

## âœ… Why This Works
- Everyone is **coding + documenting** in parallel â†’ visible GitHub contributions.  
- Each member has a **clear domain** but overlaps in integration.  
- By Day 7, youâ€™ll already have a working baseline CNN. Week 2 is about **experiments, comparisons, and polishing**.
